/*
1. You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
2. The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
3. Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
4. You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
5. You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.
